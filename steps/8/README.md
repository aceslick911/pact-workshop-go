# Pact Go workshop

## Step 8 - Authorization

It turns out that not everyone should be able to use the API. After a discussion with the team, it was decided that a time-bound bearer token would suffice. 

In the case a valid bearer token is not provided, we expect a `401`. Let's update the consumer test cases to pass the bearer token, and capture this new `401` scenario.

```
$ make consumer

--- ðŸ”¨Running Consumer Pact tests
go test github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go/consumer/client -run '^TestClientPact'
ok  	github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go/consumer/client	21.983s
```

We should now have two interactions in our pact file.

Our verification now fails, as our consumer is sending a Bearer token that is not yet understood by our provider.

```
$ make provider

--- ðŸ”¨Running Provider Pact tests
go test -count=1 -tags=integration github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go/provider -run "TestPactProvider"
